## Overview

(insert better name) is an adventure RPG that revolves around players collecting monsters styled after the periodic table of elements and combining them to fight each other.  The goal of the player is to progress through the story, exploring the foreign lands, making friends, and collecting Element monsters, Compound 'recpies', and various items in the hopes to defeat the big evil bad guy who I assume wants to do something really bad.  The story, monsters, and general polish are the last things I intend on creating.  At this stage I'm still planning the database and basic game skeleton.

## The Plan

1. Gather User stories
2. Create a Schema
3. Create a basic Wireframe for the website
4. Generate Models, Views, and Migrations
5. Create a seed
6. Implement RESTful principals to create the website routes
7. Implement a Login system
